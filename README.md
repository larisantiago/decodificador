Hi there,

This is one of my first solo projects and while it's not perfect, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish. I spent hours considering the color scheme and layout because I really enjoy working with HTML and CSS. However, I must confess that JavaScript is still a bit of a weak spot for me. Writing this post will help me track my progress and improve my skills.

The goal of this project was to create a decoder that would convert certain letters into specific phrases. 
For example:
- the letter "e" would be converted to "enter"
- the letter "i" to "imes" 
- the letter "a" to "ai" 
- the letter "o" to "ober" 
- the letter "u" to "ufat." 

I'm pleased to say that I successfully accomplished this part of the project.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the second part, which was to enable users to copy the text, clear the text area, and then convert the text back to its original form. This is a challenge that I will work to overcome in the near future by improving my JavaScript skills.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project.
